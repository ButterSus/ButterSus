### Hi there :flushed: I am EdUard Alekseevich

***

I'm a guy who really loves Minecraft and Team Fortress 2. :sunglasses:
> _P.S. If the project is not related to Minecraft, don't even try to interest me._

I want to be Embedded developer in the nearest future :cold_face:.

- :monocle_face: I am currently learning FPGA systems
- :clown_face: I have a dream - to create meta-language
- :speech_balloon: My favourite language - Kotlin, but I am not mobile developer
- :boom: My the most hated language - C++, but I love low-level programming
